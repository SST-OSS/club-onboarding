# Sort the people

## Problem Desctiption

Given two arrays `names` of size `n`, representing the names of `n` people, and `heights`, representing the heights of the people in the same order as their names, the task is to sort the names in descending order by height.

```
# Example 1:

Input: 
names = ["Eve", "Mallory", "Oscar"]
heights = [160, 155, 165]

Output: ["Oscar", "Eve", "Mallory"]

# Example 2:
Input:
names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]
heights = [150, 180, 170]

Output: ["Bob", "Charlie", "Alice"]

```
