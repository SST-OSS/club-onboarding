# Number of 1 Bits

## Problem Statement
Write a function that takes the `binary representation` of an unsigned integer and returns the number of `'1'` bits it has (also known as the `Hamming weight`).

```
# Example 1

Input: n = 00000000000000000000000000001011
Output: 3


# Example 2

Input: n = 00000000000000000000000010000000
Output: 1
