# GCD and LCM Problem Statement

## Problem Description

Write a Java program to find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) and the Lowest Common Multiple (LCM) of two integers. The program should take two integers as input and output their GCD and LCM.


### Input Format

The program should take two integers as input:

```
num1
num2
```

### Output Format

The program should output two integers:

```
GCD
LCM
```

## Constraints
- 0 < `num1`,`num2` < 10<sup>9</sup>


## Example

### Input
```
12
15
```

### Output
```
3
60
```


## Notes

- The GCD of 12 and 15 is 3.
