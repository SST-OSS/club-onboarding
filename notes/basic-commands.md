Some basic linux commands
>>>>>>> 564c83c (Fixed Spelling mistake in basic-commands.md)

- `pwd`: Print working directory
- `ls`: List all the files and directories in the folder
- `ls -la`: List all the files and directories with permissions and hidden files along with other information
- `cd`: change directory

### Variations of ls command

- `ls -R` → List all the content of all the folders inside every folder
- `ls -t` → List all content of a directory after sorting them based on modified time

### Variations of cd command
- `cd` → Change current Directory to the home directory

- `cd ../` or `cd ..` → Takes to the previous directory

- `cd folder_name` → takes us to the folder `folder_name` in the current directory

- `cd ~` → Takes to the home directory again

- **`cd directory`** → This form of the **`cd`** command is used to navigate to a specific directory. Replace "directory" with the actual path of the directory you want to navigate to.

- **`cd ../directory`** → This variation allows you to move up one level and then navigate to a specific directory in a single command. Replace "directory" with the name of the desired directory.

- **`cd /`** → This command takes you to the root directory, which is the top-level directory in the file system hierarchy.

- **`cd ~user`** → If you want to navigate to another user's home directory, you can use this syntax. Replace "user" with the username of the desired user.

- **`cd -`** (a hyphen) → takes you to the previous working directory you were in. It's a convenient way to toggle between two directories.
