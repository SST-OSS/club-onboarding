# Contributing to Mock-Project Club Onboarding

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Mock-Project Club Onboarding! We welcome contributions from the community to make this project better. There are several ways you can contribute:

### Share Your GitHub Handle

This is the first and mandatory task for all the contributers, to do this check if there's an existing issue labeled with `club-member-request` in our [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/SST-OSS/club-onboarding/issues/) and follow the instructions provided there.

### Documentation Contributions

#### 1. Locate the Documentation

All project documentation can be found in the `/notes` directory. This is where you can make improvements, fix errors, or add new information.

#### 2. Identify Areas for Improvement

Look for areas in the documentation that require updates or clarifications. This might include correcting typos, updating outdated information, or adding explanations where they are lacking.

#### 3. Follow the Documentation Structure

Maintain the existing structure and format of the documentation. This helps in keeping a consistent look and feel throughout the project's documentation.

#### 4. Create a Pull Request

When you've made your documentation changes, create a pull request (PR). Clearly describe the changes you've made and reference any relevant issues if applicable.

### Code Contributions

#### 1. Locate the Code

The project's source code is located in the `/javaProblems` directory. You can contribute to code by fixing bugs, adding features, or improving existing functionality.

#### 2. Choose an Issue

Before making code changes, look for open issues related to the part of the code you want to work on. If there isn't an existing issue, consider creating one to discuss and track your proposed changes.

### Bug report or a feature request

Feel free to open an issue if you have found a bug or wish to see a feature implemented.

In case you see any mistake in any doc, do not hesitate to submit a ticket to the [Bug Tracker](https://github.com/SST-OSS/club-onboarding/issues). You are also welcome to pull requests.

## Contributing guides

### Creating Issues

#### 1. Search for Existing Issues

Before creating a new issue, search the issue tracker to check if a similar issue already exists. If you find a relevant issue, feel free to comment and provide additional information or insights.

#### 2. Be Descriptive

When creating an issue, provide a clear and concise title that describes the problem or feature request. In the issue description:

* Include steps to reproduce a bug.
* Describe the expected behavior.
* Specify the actual behavior you observed.
* Mention any error messages or log outputs.
* If suggesting a new feature, explain its purpose and potential benefits.
* You can also use the templates provided when you click on `New issue`.

#### 3. Use Labels

Assign appropriate labels to your issue to help categorize and prioritize it. Labels may include "bug," "feature," "documentation," and others relevant to your project.

#### 4. Follow the Template

Some projects may have specific issue templates. Please follow the template provided to ensure all necessary information is included.

### Creating Pull Requests (PRs)

#### 1. Fork the Repository

To contribute code, fork the repository to your GitHub account. Create a new branch for your changes, ensuring it has a descriptive name (e.g., `feature/add-new-feature` or `bugfix/fix-issue-123`).

#### 2. Keep Your Fork Updated

Regularly sync your fork with the main repository to incorporate any changes. You can do this using Git commands or the "Sync" button on GitHub.

#### 3. Work on Isolated Branches

For each feature, bug fix, or improvement, create a separate branch. This makes it easier to manage and review your changes.

#### 4. Follow Coding Standards

Adhere to the project's coding standards and style guidelines. If there are specific conventions or formatting rules, make sure your code complies with them.

#### 5. Write Good Commit Messages

Each commit message should be concise and describe the purpose of the commit. Use the imperative mood (e.g., "Fix bug" rather than "Fixed bug").

#### 6. Provide a Clear Description

When creating a PR, include a clear and comprehensive description of your changes. Explain why the changes are necessary and how they address the issue or improve the project.

#### 7. Reference Issues

If your PR relates to a specific issue, reference it by including "Fixes #issue-number" or "Closes #issue-number" in the PR description. This automatically links the PR to the issue and helps with issue tracking.

#### 8. Keep PRs Focused

Keep PRs focused on a single, well-defined task or feature. If you have multiple changes to propose, create separate PRs for each.

#### 10. Be Patient and Responsive

Maintainers and reviewers may take some time to review your PR. Be patient and responsive to their feedback and requests for changes.

Thank you for contributing to club-onboarding. Your involvement is invaluable to the growth and improvement of our project. Happy coding!
